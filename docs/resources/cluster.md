A representation of a cluster you can deploy to.



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Human-readable name of this cluster, that also translates to cloud resource name.

### Optional

- `bindings` (Attributes) Read and write policies of this cluster. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--bindings))
- `detach` (Boolean) Determines behavior during resource destruction, if true it will detach resource instead of deleting it.
- `handle` (String) A short, unique human-readable name used to identify this cluster. Does not necessarily map to the cloud resource name.
- `helm_repo_url` (String) Helm repository URL you'd like to use in deployment agent Helm install.
- `helm_values` (String) Additional Helm values you'd like to use in deployment agent Helm installs. This is useful for BYOK clusters that need to use custom images or other constructs.
- `kubeconfig` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--kubeconfig))
- `metadata` (String) Arbitrary JSON metadata to store user-specific state of this cluster (e.g. IAM roles for add-ons). Use `jsonencode` and `jsondecode` methods to encode and decode data.
- `project_id` (String) ID of the project that this cluster belongs to.
- `protect` (Boolean) If set to `true` then this cluster cannot be deleted.
- `tags` (Map of String) Key-value tags used to filter clusters.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Internal identifier of this cluster.
- `inserted_at` (String) Creation date of this cluster.

### Nested Schema for `bindings`

Optional:

- `read` (Attributes Set) Read policies of this cluster. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--bindings--read))
- `write` (Attributes Set) Write policies of this cluster. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--bindings--write))

### Nested Schema for `bindings.read`

Optional:

- `group_id` (String)
- `id` (String)
- `user_id` (String)


<a id="nestedatt--bindings--write"></a>
### Nested Schema for `bindings.write`

Optional:

- `group_id` (String)
- `id` (String)
- `user_id` (String)



<a id="nestedatt--kubeconfig"></a>
### Nested Schema for `kubeconfig`

Optional:

- `client_certificate` (String) The path to a client cert file for TLS. Can be sourced from `PLURAL_KUBE_CLIENT_CERT_DATA`.
- `client_key` (String, Sensitive) The path to a client key file for TLS. Can be sourced from `PLURAL_KUBE_CLIENT_KEY_DATA`.
- `cluster_ca_certificate` (String) The path to a cert file for the certificate authority. Can be sourced from `PLURAL_KUBE_CLUSTER_CA_CERT_DATA`.
- `config_context` (String) kubeconfig context to use. Can be sourced from `PLURAL_KUBE_CTX`.

- `config_context_cluster` (String) Can be sourced from `PLURAL_KUBE_CTX_CLUSTER`.
- `config_path` (String) Path to the kubeconfig file. Can be sourced from `PLURAL_KUBE_CONFIG_PATH`.
- `exec` (Attributes List) Specifies a command to provide client credentials (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--kubeconfig--exec))
- `host` (String) The complete address of the Kubernetes cluster, using scheme://hostname:port format. Can be sourced from `PLURAL_KUBE_HOST`.
- `insecure` (Boolean) Skips the validity check for the server's certificate. This will make your HTTPS connections insecure. Can be sourced from `PLURAL_KUBE_INSECURE`.
- `password` (String, Sensitive) The password for basic authentication to the Kubernetes cluster. Can be sourced from `PLURAL_KUBE_PASSWORD`.
- `proxy_url` (String) The URL to the proxy to be used for all requests made by this client. Can be sourced from `PLURAL_KUBE_PROXY_URL`.
- `tls_server_name` (String) TLS server name is used to check server certificate. If it is empty, the hostname used to contact the server is used. Can be sourced from `PLURAL_KUBE_TLS_SERVER_NAME`.
- `token` (String, Sensitive) Token is the bearer token for authentication to the Kubernetes cluster. Can be sourced from `PLURAL_KUBE_TOKEN`.
- `username` (String) The username for basic authentication to the Kubernetes cluster. Can be sourced from `PLURAL_KUBE_USER`.
